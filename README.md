# UFOs
### Overview of Project
* Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
We are adding funcntionality to the end product webpage by adding multiple filters.




### Results
* One would use this website to garner an idea of the amount of UFO sightings that have occurred in a given time in a given place. See below for an idea of someone who filtered with a specific date in mind from White Oak PA.

### Summary
Drawback- One drawback of this webpage is the lack of interaction, would think adding an interactive map that corresponds to sightings would be helpful.
Recommentations- 
* Adding an interactive map that shows all sightings and timing.
* Create a better HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Work interaction that feed UFOs data from most concise and automate workload
